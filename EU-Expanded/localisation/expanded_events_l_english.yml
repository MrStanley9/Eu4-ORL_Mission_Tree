 flavor_orl.1.desc:1 "Our situation as an appage to the French crown has historically proven useful, allowing the French people to stand united against the invading English. However, the seige of Orleans in 1429 has taught us that there is nobody we can rely on but our own. The French have many enemies, and many of them would be more than happy to support us in our cause for independence.\nHowever, it would be more glorious if our nation manages to win the Independence War on its own, and that would bring us the respect of the other monarchies of Europe."
 flavor_orl.1.a:0 "We need every supporter we can find though."
 flavor_orl.1.a.tt:1 "Every Rival or Enemy of §Y[FRA.GetName]§!, which has at least §Y0§! opinion of [Root.GetName], will support the independence of §Y[Root.GetName]§!."

 flavor_orl.2.desc:2 "This morning envoys from [From.GetName] reached the [Root.GetAdjective] court. They have requested our support for their pursuit of independence. While we might not have much in common with the [From.GetAdjective] people, they are a subject of our enemy France. By supporting them we would be able to weaken our enemy, and expand our own influence."
 flavor_orl.2.a:0 "We will support [From.GetName]!"
 flavor_orl.2.b:0 "There is not much to gain from an independent [From.GetName]."

 flavor_orl.1000.desc.a:0 "Our victory over the French has shown the world that we do not need any allies. The [Root.GetAdjective] people are all that it takes to defeat the tyranny of the French crown, and this brought us the respect and glory of Europe!"
 flavor_orl.1000.desc.b:0 "Our [Root.GovernmentName] is in the middle of the War for [Root.GetAdjective] Independence. The morale of our troops is higher than ever - until they tried to talk with their fellow comrades on the battlefield in French. Apparently, the new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] already broke [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] first promise in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] career as a ruler, and summoned allies who shall carry us to victory. While it might be a strategical decision, it surely hampered the morale of our forces.\nDefinitely a disappointing start of the new [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty. Let us hope that future actions by the newly sovereign [Root.GetAdjective] government won't disappoint the [Root.GetAdjective] people any further."
